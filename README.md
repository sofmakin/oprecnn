# oprecnn
Codes for the computations of applying feedforward and operator recurrent neural networks for the volume inversion problem and the matrix inversion problem. 

The following files were copied/modified from corresponding files from l-oksanen/oprecnn even though that is not showing on contributions:
vol_inversion_nn.ipynb, vol_inv_data.py, simple_inversion_feedforward_net.ipynb, for_opnet_vol_inv_data.py, simple_inversion_data.py.
